## 🌐 **ABSTRACT** 🖥️
The design of this website is done with JS, CSS, and HTML. 

![HTML](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/08/05/11/16/logo-2582748_960_720.png)
I utilize HTML for layout and frame; I make use of tags, spans, and many other properties. 
With the use of features like div, text properties, flexbox, color, gradient, transform, skew, translate, and many more, CSS is used to customize the HTML layout.
