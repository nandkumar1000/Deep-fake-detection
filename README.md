## 🌐 **ABSTRACT** 🖥️
The design of this website is done with JS, CSS, and HTML. 
I utilize HTML for layout and frame; I make use of tags, spans, and many other properties. 
With the use of features like div, text properties, flexbox, color, gradient, transform, skew, translate, and many more, CSS is used to customize the HTML layout. 
This website's backend uses JavaScript to function. 

** note. "Some of the files like js, Python, database, and ML are not uploaded." .

##  🌟 **Font Awesome** 🎨

Font Awesome is a popular icon set and toolkit for web development. 
It offers a vast library of scalable vector icons that can be easily customized. 
Developers use FontAwesome to enhance the visual appeal and usability of websites and applications. 
The icons are easily implemented using simple HTML and CSS code. 
FontAwesome simplifies the process of integrating stylish and responsive icons into projects. 🚀


** This website's primary goal is to give users an interface and verify whether or not the voice, video, and image are real.
